# Cat and Dog Image Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. SVM is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm that is widely used for image classification tasks.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cat-dog-classification.git
cd cat-dog-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Make sure to customize the parameters in the script, such as the SVM kernel, input data file paths, and any other relevant settings.

## Dataset

The input data for this project is the Kaggle dataset containing images of cats and dogs. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) and organize it into training and testing sets. The script assumes the following directory structure:

```
cat-dog-classification/
|-- data/
|   |-- train/
|       |-- cat/
|       |-- dog/
|   |-- test/
|       |-- cat/
|       |-- dog/
```


## Results

Include performance metrics, confusion matrices, or visualizations that showcase the results of the SVM classification on the test dataset.
